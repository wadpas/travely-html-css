                    <p> With its golden beaches, turquoise water teeming with marine life, and varied landscapes—from
                        rain
                        forests to mangroves
                        to mountains—it’s a wonder Roatán isn’t more widely known. And yet, the tiny island off the
                        north
                        coast of Honduras
                        remains blissfully off the radar of most travelers (save for backpackers who have long loved it
                        for
                        its budget prices).

                        Later in 2023, Kimpton will open its first Honduran property on Roatán, likely bringing with it
                        a
                        rush of new interest
                        in the island. For now, however, it remains one of the best destinations for a Caribbean
                        vacation
                        without the high costs
                        or crowds. Read on for where to eat, stay, and play and get started planning the perfect
                        tropical
                        trip. </p>
                    <h2>What to do in Roatán</h2>
                    <p>Framed by the second-largest coral reef in the world, Roatán is all about getting in the water.
                        Snorkeling, scuba
                        diving, and glass-bottomed boat tours with outfitters like Hyde Tours and Las Moskitia Eco
                        Adventures are popular ways
                        to see the reef, but for a more special experience, go with Las Cascadas Lodge to Cayos
                        Cochinos, an isolated
                        archipelago and marine preserve where you can spot jewel-toned fish and sea turtles in the
                        healthiest water in the
                        country. It takes about an hour to sail to this archipelago, inhabited only by the
                        Afro-Indigenous Garifuna people. Once
                        there, you’ll take a dip in the pristine water, then go hiking to try and spot native pink boa
                        constrictors.

                        To learn more about Roatán’s Garifuna population, pay a visit to Punta Gorda on the northeast
                        end of the island. The
                        town is Roatán’s oldest permanent settlement, founded in 1797 by Garifuna deportees from Saint
                        Vincent, who were
                        stranded here by the British. On Sundays, the village comes alive with a festive street party
                        featuring live music,
                        dancing, and food like sopa de pescado (a fish-and-coconut-milk soup that’s scooped up with
                        machuca, bites of mashed
                        yellow and green plantains).

                        Another must-do is Las Cascada Lodge’s waterfall rappelling tour, which tests you physically and
                        mentally with a trek
                        through the rainforest before descending a waterfall on a rope. If you’re after something
                        slightly less extreme, go
                        floating through serene mangrove tunnels with a local guide to learn about Roatán’s fascinating
                        ecosystem and natural
                        history, or tour Gumbalimba Park to see local Capuchin monkeys, macaws, sloths, and iguanas.</p>
                    <h2>What to eat</h2>
                    <p>Honduran food is a delicious blend of local seafood and Indigenous, Spanish, and Caribbean
                        flavors. The most beloved
                        dish, baleada, involves a wheat-flour tortilla stuffed with refried beans, cheese, and cream,
                        all sprinkled with your
                        choice of toppings like scrambled eggs, chorizo, and avocado. A popular breakfast food, baleadas
                        can be found at
                        Calelu’s, a West End cafe and grocery, where you can also enjoy hearty dishes like seafood soup
                        and chicken with rice
                        and beans.

                        For elegant dining, try Romeo’s Restaurant, a waterfront bistro on French Harbour that serves
                        Italian and Caribbean
                        cuisine. Here, you can pair dishes like chorizo-and-gorgonzola pizza and whole red snapper in
                        Creole sauce with live
                        music and ocean views. Also check out Yurumei Sports Bar and Restaurant in Punta Gorda for
                        Garifuna specialties like
                        sopa de caracol (a rich conch soup that’s a favorite all over Honduras) and gifity (a spirit
                        made with herbs and rum).
                        The spot sits right on the beach, so you can watch the fishermen catching the ingredients for
                        your meal.

                        Roatán’s top gourmet experience can be found at Azul, the main restaurant at the upscale Blue
                        Roatán Resort in West Bay.
                        The chef’s menu offers an array of elevated Caribbean dishes, from conch carpaccio to
                        coconut-cream lobster.</p>
                    <h2>Where to stay </h2>
                    <p>Though small in size, Roatán boasts everything from budget rooms for backpackers to five-star
                        resorts. The best places
                        to stay, however, highlight the island’s natural resources. The Lodge & Spa at Pico Bonito
                        plunges guests into tropical
                        splendor with spacious cabins surrounded by lush gardens and cacao groves, plus a striking
                        mountain backdrop. Each cabin
                        has a private porch and hammock for taking in the scenery, and the resort features its own
                        hiking trails as well as a
                        spa that uses organic ingredients grown in on-site gardens.

                        Ibagari Boutique Hotel's open-air lobby displays local art and wooden furniture, while the
                        infinity pool offers sweeping
                        ocean views. In the plush rooms, balconies and deep-soaking tubs make for a luxurious stay.
                        There’s also a fantastic
                        restaurant, Luna Muna, serving king crab tortellini and beef tenderloin with mushroom risotto.

                        In summer 2023, the already stunning Grand Roatan Resort will become a Kimpton hotel after a
                        major expansion that
                        includes 126 renovated guest rooms and seven new suites with plunge pools overlooking the
                        Caribbean Sea. For the time
                        being, guests can still look forward to suites with outdoor showers and private terraces
                        surrounded by bougainvillea, as
                        well as the show-stopping Kao Kamasa Spa, which draws inspiration from indigenous Pech culture
                        for treatments like an
                        obsidian palm stone massage in a temazcal (sauna).</p>

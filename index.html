      The Hugo Award for Best Novel is one of the Hugo Awards given each year for
      science fiction or fantasy stories published
      in, or translated to, English during the previous calendar year. The novel award is available for works of fiction
      of
      40,000 words or more; awards are also given out in the short story, novelette, and novella categories. The Hugo
      Awards
      have been described as "a fine showcase for speculative fiction", and "the best known literary award for science
      fiction
      writing".

      The Hugo Award for Best Novel has been awarded annually by the World Science Fiction Society since 1953, except in
      1954
      and 1957. In addition, beginning in 1996, Retrospective Hugo Awards or "Retro-Hugos" have been available for works
      published 50, 75, or 100 years prior. Retro-Hugos may only be awarded for years after 1939 in which no awards were
      originally given.[3] To date, Retro-Hugo awards have been given for novels for 1939, 1941, 1943â€“1946, 1951, and
      1954.[4]
